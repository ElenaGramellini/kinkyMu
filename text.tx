Research Report: Exploring New Physics Opportunities with Massive Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers
Project Overview: This research report presents the outcomes and achievements of the collaborative project between the TAU-Manchester team, which aimed to explore new physics opportunities with massive Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs). The project utilized cosmic ray muons detected by the MicroBooNE detector to address two primary objectives: constraining uncertainties in neutrino interaction models and conducting a novel search for a portal to dark matter associated with muon interactions.
Project Achievements: Throughout the course of the project, significant progress was made in achieving the outlined objectives. The following summarizes the key achievements:
	•	Muon Interaction Selection: The project successfully developed techniques to identify cosmic muon tracks with kinks or accompanying vertices, indicative of interactions possibly mediated by dark matter particles. This accomplishment enabled the selection of muon events that were previously discarded as background, turning them into valuable data points for analysis. 
	•	Muon Momentum Measurement Algorithms: Innovative algorithms were developed to accurately measure the momenta of incoming and outgoing muons using the multiple coulomb scattering of muons in argon. These algorithms significantly improved the precision of momentum estimation, enhancing the overall data quality. 
	•	Dark Matter Search: The project yielded groundbreaking results in the search for a portal to dark matter associated with muon interactions. Utilizing the selected muon events, the Manchester team's expertise in the "thin slice" technique, pioneered by Dr. Gramellini, enabled a successful and original approach to dark matter searches. 
	•	Neutrino Interaction Model Constraints: The TAU team's expertise in neutrino interaction modeling led to the successful constraint of uncertainties in neutrino interaction models. By incorporating external data and leveraging the cosmic ray muon events, the project contributed to enhancing the accuracy of neutrino experiments. 
Publication and Impact: The project resulted in a series of impactful publications, which significantly contributed to the advancement of particle physics:
